![Splash](/static/images/readme.png)  

**Splash** is a 1v1 platform game available on [N&M Games](https://nm-games.eu/g/9). Two players, a yellow and a green rounded rectangle are standing on a platform above water. Both players have the objective to push their enemy in the water. The game is also available for the [DJO Lichtkrant](https://github.com/djoamersfoort/lichtkrant/blob/main/states/games/splash.mod.py).

## Tournament
### Time
A Splash game lasts for 45 seconds. The timer is shown in the top right corner.
### Draw
There is no draw in the Splash tournament!
- When the timer runs out, the red and blue surfaces of the platform fall in the water, reducing the play area;
- When both players simultaneously fall in the water, the winner will randomly be determined.
### Rounds
The amount of participants must be a power of 2 to have a clear structure for the tournament. Everyone will randomly battle someone else. Afterwards, half of the participants remain. Repeat that until there is one champion!
### Prize
The prize for the champion will likely be a bag of M&M's.

# Good luck and have fun!
